This repo contains the code for a poker game played between 'N' players. This code gives game statistics only.
This code gives pre-flop percentages of the HERO's hand in a N-player table.
On a side note, the percentages are pretty accurate and I myself use them while playing online poker. There are still some edge cases not taken into account but they are so rare that they hardly impact the pre-flop percentages.


Dependencies: This shows the file dependencies in the code. The main code is PreFlopPercentages.py.

Cards -> Poker -> PokerHands -> PokerRules -> PreFlopPercentages


FUTURE WORK: This code doesn't take into account the play between different players. Also, only pre-flop percentages are given. 
The game changes dramatically post-flop and with the turn and the river. It would be ncie to encode that into the game. 

Shoot me an email in case you are interested in collaborating or extending the code.
